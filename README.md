## Hey I'm Dravin 👋

I am in my final year pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Statistics at the University of Toronto!

Currently I am a Software Developer intern at RBC, where I am spearheading the development of an analytics tool measuring team productivity and growth, 
estimated to save $30MM in development costs over the next 3 years. I've also completed past internships at RBC as a Software Developer on the ClientSource team, working on the HSBC migration

In my free time you can find me swimming 🏊🏽‍♂️, running 🏃🏽‍♂️, listening to house music 🎧, trying new restaurants 🍽️, and travelling 🌏! 

## Feel free to reach out, I'd love to chat 🙂
